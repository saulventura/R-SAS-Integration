# R & SAS Integration

During the completion of this project, I used R to convey higher quality data to SAS Enterprise Miner that can handle more than one machine learning algorithm easily.
SAS also allowed me to use its model comparison node to compare the performance of some models. So, instead of use just one tool, I took advantage of the best of two worlds.
